# Digital-Brochure---Voice
Android studio - Java/xml

 This paper presents the Digital Brochure application for transformation from speech to text or from text to speech to inform the customers of the Giorgia restaurant about the menu provided. For the installation and use of this application, version compatibility between the programming environment and the programming language is required. The application is made in Android Studio with the help of the Android programming language, where the voice signal is taken from the microphone for the first transformation, and the text is string, included in the code, for the other transformation.

 #Functionality

 The step-by-step description of this project is described in the "Documentation - Voice" document!
 The functionality of this project can be seen in the "Voice-video" video!

 When using the Digital Brochure application through the Android Estudi application, we have the possibility to press the 'Menu details' button which exposes the controls available to the application, so that there are 7 possible voice commands: breakfast, meat, gaskets, pasta, fish, pizza and hamburger.

 If we say 'pizza' into the microphone, the command will be made and we will be directed to the page with the menus about pizza.

There you will find images and a button that will tell us about the price to inform the customer.

There is also a button that, also through a voice command, will return us again to the main menu to be able to search for something else if we still need it.

The app works to see Giorgia's restaurant menu an infinite number of times. Finally, when the customer has been informed about this menu, the application has a button that thanks you for viewing. All of these things are synconized into a nice, easy-to-use interface.
